Games can be downloaded from either chess.com or lichess.org.
If desired the download can be restricted to a certain color, time control and date range.

The time control is specified as a comma-seperated list, with the default `blitz,rapid,classical,correspondence`.
The possible values are:
- for Lichess: `ultraBullet`, `bullet`, `blitz`, `rapid`, `classical`, `correspondence`, `chess960`, `crazyhouse`, `antichess`, `atomic`, `horde`, `kingOfTheHill`, `racingKings`, `threeCheck`
- for chess.com: `correspondence`, `rapid`, `blitz`, `bullet`

The date ranges can be selected with the flags `--since` and `--until`.
They accept either absolute or relative time ranges:
- absolute: `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY-MM-DD`
- relative: number with suffix `y` for years, `m` for months, `d` for days or `h` for hours.

All dates specified with `--since` are interpreted as the earliest possible, while `--until` dates are interpreted as the latest possible (see examples)Â·
All dates are taken in local time.



Examples:
- absolute:
  - `--since 2021`: games since Jan 1 2021
  - `--since 2019 --until 2020`: games between Jan 1 2019 until Dec 31 2020
  - `--since 2018-05-04 --until 2019-07` games between May 4 2018 until July 31 2019
- relative as executed on 2021-06-04 16:30
  - `--since 3m`: games since Mar 1 2021
  - `--since 0d`: games from today
  - `--since 1d`: games since June 3 2021
  - `--until 3m`: games until Mar 31 2021
